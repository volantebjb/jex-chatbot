## Abstract

With companies and businesses growing massively more connected through the booming courier, express, and parcel (CEP) market in the Philippines, courier delivery services (CDSs) are becoming more integral to the business process as a whole. However, there is no means to review these services. With this, the researchers made an Android application with chatbot made in Google Cloud Dialogflow ES and integrated with Kommunicate. The data were stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore and exported to analyze the sentiment of each user queries. Further analysis and summary of the findings are presented through Microsoft Excel. The researchers identified the most preferred delivery location and preferred delivery time of the customers. The researchers were able to collect customer sentiments towards the CDS that were divided into five categories namely (1) service flexibility, (2) service reliability, (3) service standardization, and (4) service attitude. The researchers were also able to collect CX from the performance of CDSs and these queries underwent sentiment analysis. With these data, the CDSs can identify their strengths and weaknesses and further improve them.
